ðŸ”¹ What is Input Validation?

Input validation is the process of checking and sanitizing data provided by users (or external sources) before using it in your system.
It ensures the data is correct, safe, and expected.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as a security guard at the entrance: only letting in valid and safe data.




ðŸ”¹ Why is Input Validation Important?


Security:-

1.Prevents SQL Injection (e.g., DROP TABLE users;)

2.Prevents XSS attacks (malicious <script> tags injected in forms).

3.Prevents API abuse by rejecting malformed data.



Data Integrity:-

1.Ensures only valid, expected values go into the database.

2.Example: Userâ€™s age should be a number, not "twenty".



Error Handling:-

Helps return meaningful error messages when data is invalid.
